abstract: The use of electronic device by drivers poses a significant safety risk; However, distractions appear likely to impact operations as well as safety. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2013) reported that about 69% of the total drivers of the United States talk on their cell phone, 31% email or read and send text messages while driving. A 2014 report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) focused on the behavioral factors that contributed to 32,999 highway fatalities and 3.9 million injuries in the US in 2014.  In urban transportation, performance of signalized intersection requires significant attention because it represents the primary source of delay for urban roads. Saturation flow, lost time and the queue length represent the important parameters for the planning, design and control of a signalized intersection.  Distracted driving may cause a vehicle to travel at a lower than expected speed or fail to move when receiving the right-of-way. Failure to response immediately when the signal turns green may have an impact on start-up lost time. At the on-set of green, the perception-reaction time varies from time to time and place to place due to- distracted drivers, psychological factors and other circumstances.  On the other hand, the ideal saturation flow rate is defined as the equivalent hourly rate at which previously queued vehicles can traverse an intersection approach under prevailing condition, assuming that the green signal is available at all times and no lost time are experienced.  But ideally, many sorts of driver distraction impinge on driver and increases startup lost time.  The delays at traffic signals contribute an estimated 5 to 10 percent of all traffic delay. In 2017, in the US alone, congestion cost about $305 billion. Electronic device distraction requires careful exploration to quantify any costs associated with the operational inefficiencies that it introduces.
