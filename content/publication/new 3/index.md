abstract: This study is aimed to investigate the causes of road accidents at Dhaka-Comilla highway which is one of the busiest highways in Bangladesh. This highway is one of the most important highways in Bangladesh as it connects two most important cities Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh and Chittagong the main port city of the country. Investigation was based on field survey that includes photogrammetric survey and questionnaire survey. Questionnaires were done on drivers and pedestrians. For this purpose 100 people were selected in each category. Investigation reveals that according to drivers the main reason for accident is overtaking and 33% agreed on this cause. 32% and 26% drivers think that main reason for accidents are unawareness and narrow roads respectively. Almost half of the driver (47%) blamed pedestrians as the main responsible groups for accident. On the other hand 34% pedestrians think unawareness is the main cause of accident. 32% thinks overtaking is the main cause and 27% thinks untrained drivers in the road are the main reason for accident. 47% pedestrians blamed drivers as the main responsible group for an accident. Field survey shows lots portion of the highway has poor road surface and has narrow width. Reckless driving, over speed and overtaking tendency were found as common phenomenon. Also there were not enough overhead bridges or zebra crossing for pedestrians to cross the roads. There are not enough speed breakers and have a number of roads with sharp bending which increase the chances of road accidents.
