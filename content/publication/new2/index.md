abstract: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 5,987 pedestrians and 840 pedalcyclist were killed in the year of 2016. While the average rate of pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 residents was 1.51, the average pedal cyclist fatality rate was 2.31 for the year of 2012. Physical activity (PA) among residents is rising as MPOs, states, cities and communities around the country are increasingly adopting the concept of Complete Streets to ensure the safe, efficient and affordable movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders. Unfortunately, studies also show that the total number of pedestrian fatalities has increased almost 46 percent since 2009. The above trends are significant enough that researchers continue to conduct multiple studies to understand the governing factors for crashes, establish the relationship between crashes and influencing factors, and develop tools to assess impacts. Different factors such as vehicle speed, transportation facility characteristics, land use, intersection types, risk exposures, and characteristics of built environment has been found influential for pedestrian and bicycle crashes and severity of injuries.

Hence, there is a need for a practical approach to evaluating existing transportation infrastructure conditions that can be applied across different contexts. Two broad types of approaches- quantitative and qualitative approaches has been practiced by the researches for developing the relationship between crash types, numbers and rates with the factors. While quantitative approach mostly use probability and multinomial logit models to quantify the relationship between explanatory variable and pedestrian injury severity, qualitative approach develops index or score based methods rated by professionals to assess the impact of transportation and roadway environmental factors. Crash based and risk based safety performance measures are generally found in literature. But this study presents a sketch planning metric, called a safety index, as a qualitative surrogate safety measure for determining the relationship between selected infrastructure elements for pedestrian and bicyclist safety at both segments and intersections.

A total of 132 safety engineers, planners, city traffic engineers and public health professionals provided their expert opinion on the importance of transportation infrastructure elements in providing safe active transportation for pedestrian and bicyclist and the level of safety impact of various options under each element. A fuzzy scale approach was used to calculate the weight of each elements from the first expert feedbacks establishing four linguistic variables (least important, moderately important, important and most important) and evaluating the elemental weights using geometric mean method. With second expert survey on each elemental option, a concordance analysis was conducted to identify the degree of dominance of one option over others of each elements. The weighted score from the product of fuzzy element weights and elemental option scores provides the Pedestrian Safety Assessment Index (PSAI) and Bicyclist Safety Assessment Index (BSAI). As a given elemental option received responses for all three levels of safety, there exist three levels of pedestrian or bicycle safety with different proportions of impacting safety. Hence, if index values for all possible infrastructure conditions are developed, then the relationship between proportions of three safety level value is developed

The index-based analytical tool can help transportation agencies in the decision making process related to active transportation investments. Researcher or practitioners can identify both corridor level and intersection level indexes for determining the safety level of a specific facility. This will eventually help determining network level performance measure for the study area.
