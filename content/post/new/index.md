CDMP Phase II is a continuation of the highly successful first phase, which laid the foundations for institutionalising risk reduction approaches and frameworks through pilot testing. The second phase, working with the goals of the Hyogo Framework for Action as an over-arching reference, aims to reduce Bangladeshâ€™s vulnerability to adverse natural and manmade hazards and extreme events, including the devastating potential impact of climate change. This focus closely aligns with the concern by many to see climate change adaptation more effectively linked to disaster risk reduction. The project aims to institutionalise the adoption of risk reduction approaches across Government, not just in its host Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, but more broadly throughout other key ministries and their line agencies. Furthermore, it will engage with partners beyond the government by channelling support to NGOs and academic institutions. By strengthening the capacity of the national disaster management system in Bangladesh, unacceptable risks will be reduced and response and recovery activities will be improved in a new culture of comprehensive risk management. Following a multi-hazard approach to disasters, including climate change risk management, the project seeks to create and nurture this crucial paradigm shift
