More communities are using green pavement markings to delineate at intersections where cyclists should wait at a traffic signal, start a left turn, or cross the roadway.  In 2011, the Federal Highway Administration issued a memo giving interim approval (IA-14) for the optional use of green colored pavement for bike lanes as a traffic control device for inclusion in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).  The FHWA indicated that they found the green pavement markings to be successful for bicycle applications because cyclists felt safer and drivers felt more aware that cyclists may be present.  In addition, the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) included green pavement markings in their Bikeway Design Guide.  The Receiving Agency has requested research into the safety and behavioral implications of using green colored pavement and their performance to help inform an agency opinion on their use in Texas communities and possible inclusion in the Texas MUTCD.
