The saturation flow, headway and lost time are derived from historical data. This may have been collected during various combination of circumstances such as electronic distractions at intersections. With new technology such as smart phones and in-vehicle entertainment systems, signal timing now requires to consider driver distraction and consequent start-up delay at intersections. The research team is conducting study to understand the factors contributing to start-up delay focusing on driver’s distracted behaviors such as using a cell phone, eating, talking to other passengers, grooming, or being distracted by outside objects. They are also doing quantitative assessments on start-up delay and the associated distraction behaviors for different sites.
