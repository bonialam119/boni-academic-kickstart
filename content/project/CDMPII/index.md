Multi-hazard Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Modeling and Mapping Project study, would create the basis for “building long term preparedness through strengthening disaster risk management capacity in Bangladesh as well as for enhancement of long term disaster risk mitigation and reduction ability of the Department of Disaster Management (DDM)”. The study also will contribute towards incorporating appropriate risk-reduction strategies and prioritizing them into the country’s development planning process. It is expected that the findings of the proposed study will allow decision makers to prioritize risk mitigation investments and measures to strengthen the emergency preparedness and response mechanisms for reducing the losses and damages due to future disaster events. The main aim of this assignment is to map out all hazard prone areas of Bangladesh specifically district, City Corporation, municipality, upazila and unions covering geological, hydro-meteorological and technological hazards and assess the exposure and vulnerability of the people, properties, infrastructure and economic activities to these above mentioned hazards.
