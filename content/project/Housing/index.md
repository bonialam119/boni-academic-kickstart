The North Texas Regional Housing Assessment (NTRHA) was created in 2016 as a consortium of 20 Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) cities and housing authorities to respond to the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâ€™s (HUD) requirement to complete an Assessment of Fair Housing. A team of researchers representing the Department of Civil Engineering and the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs of the University of Texas at Arlington were contracted to complete the assessment on behalf of the consortium members using HUD-provided data and analytical tools.
